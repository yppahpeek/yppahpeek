- 👋 Hi, I’m @yppahpeek
- 👀 I’m interested in creating web apps and using Python to visualise data.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the absolute basics of setting up an IDE to develop a Flask app.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate when I feel more comfortable with what I know and how to ask sensible questions.
- 📫 How to reach me on here? Or on Twitter @yppahpeek
